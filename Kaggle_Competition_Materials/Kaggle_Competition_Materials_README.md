# Kaggle_Competition_Materials README
This is a README for the Kaggle_Competition_Materials Folder of 6thManProject. In this README we will provide an outline of what each of the files in this section contains, how they should be used, and whether or not a Kaggle Competition Participant Would Have Access to them. 

## Available CSV's Folder

This folder contains all of the CSV's that the Kaggle Partipant has at their disposal for the creation of their model, so naturally the participant will be able to access them. The Kaggler's Guide provides a great description as to what these files contain, and how the participant should use them. Additionally, the 'Benchmark Solution Example' provides a great example of these CSV's in action. 

The Files in this folder can be generated by running the generate_all_csvs() that is found in Kaggle_Comp.py. This can be run in the terminal or the base playground.ipynb when you are in the base of the repository. 

## Hidden CSV Folder

This folder contains the solutions.csv that will be used for determining the Mean Absolute Error of the Participants model. This will not be available to the Kaggle Competition Participant. The 'Benchmark Solution Example' uses this csv to calculate the MAE of the model created by the participant in that example. 

## Benchmark Solution Example.ipynb

This notebook, apart from the last two cells, will be available to the Kaggle Competition Participant when it is submitted to Kaggle. This notebook walks the participant through the steps of loading in the Available CSV's, splitting them into training/test sets, and evaluating different models based on MAE. Once the models have been evaluated, the notebook also shows the participant how they could generate and format their final submisison for predictions. 

The last two cells of the notebook show how the solutions.csv will be used to evaluate the participants submission, and also shows how we determined the benchmark MAE of .66.
