# How important are 6th Men to Team Success?
## Summary 
Hello future general managers and NBA Fans, welcome to our Kaggle Compeition!
In this competition you will use use the statistics of all the 6th men since 2000-01 to predict team success, which is quantified by team win percentage. 

We have gone through the game logs of each nba game in the past two decades, and have kept track of who the first person into the game was for each team. We were then able to calculate who the 6th man was for each team every season. These players have been added to the dataset that you will be using! 

The competition is simple: use the single season 6th man player statistics to predict their team's win percentage!
