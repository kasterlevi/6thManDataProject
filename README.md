# 6thManProject
Hi! Welcome to the README for Sam, Levi, and Nate's 6th Man project! Here we will give an overview of what is included in our repository, and how we suggest you use each of these items. Thank you!

## Kaggle_Competition_Materials Folder
This Folder Contains all of the information pertinent to the Kaggle Compeition. It includes a Kaggler's Guide, all of the CSV's that the Participant has access to, and an example of how someone can participate. This Folder has it's own README, so I would suggest checking that out for more in depth information on everything that this guide includes. 

## Data Folder
This folder contains all of the CSV's that we used to create the final dataset's for the Kaggle Competition. Further descriptions of how we obtained these datasets can be found below, but in short each of these datasets required data manipulation and/or the use of the nba_api to obtain the data. 

[Nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) is a great, continuously-updated API which can be used to pull game logs and statistics for all nba teams and players from nba.com. We highly suggest using it for any nba related inquirys that you might have.
